# whatsgoingon
=whatsgoingon= is a very thin wrapper to help keep track of software running status and its outputs, such as research experiments. I created it to quickly keep track of the many research experiments I was running simultaneously. 

You can use =whatsgoingon= to keep track of:

- Experiment status (running/completed/etc.)
- Specific notes associated with the project (i.e. hyperparameters, run results)
- Specific files associated with the project
