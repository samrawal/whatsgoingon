* whatsgoingon
=whatsgoingon= is a very thin wrapper to help keep track of software running status and its outputs, such as research experiments. I created it to quickly keep track of the many research experiments I was running simultaneously. 

You can use =whatsgoingon= to keep track of:

- Experiment status (running/completed/etc.)
- Specific notes associated with the project (i.e. hyperparameters, run results)
- Specific files associated with the project

  

** The information you can log
*** Run Details
    - Each run is under a "project" (each project gets its own database)
    - Each run has a "nickname"
    - Each run has a "notes" section (i.e. description of the run, hyperparameters used, etc.)
*** Run Status Info
    - Run start time
    - Run end time
*** Files
    - Two main ways of storing files: softlinks and hardcopies
        - **softlinks**: just capture the absolute path of the particular file and store it
        - **hardcopy**: copy over files to the directory in `whatsgoingon → project → nickname`
            - pickle: pass in Python object, save as pickle
            - copyfile: copy a written file over to the directory


** How to use
Running =whatsgoingon= for the first time will result in a configuration file being created at =~/.whatsgoingon.config= and a directory at =~/.whatsgoingon=. You can change the path of the directory in the config file, and specify the config file path when using =whatsgoingon= in your code as well.


#+BEGIN_SRC python
from whatsgoingon import whatsgoingon as wgo

w = wgo('MyProject', 'RunName_1')
w.start()

w.add_notes('Hyperparameters for my run: alpha=0.5, beta=0.2')

# any code you want to track here
train_model_here()
results = get_results()

# log some files -- softlink, hardcopy, or hardcopy_pickle
# softcopy will only store a link to a path (like filepath)
# hardcopy will copy over the file/data object to the `whatsgoingon` project directory
w.file_softlink('my_model.hd5')
w.file_hardcopy('experiment_results.txt')
w.file_hardcopy_pickle(results, 'results.p')

w.end()
#+END_SRC




** Monitoring Runs
Running =serve.py= will launch a Flask app that will allow you to select a project, which you can select to view the runs for that project.
